# rotary-radio
Turn your rotary phone into an online radio !

This repo is meant to be used with the instructions that can be found here: ///Arduino Link here///.

## This repo consists of three parts:
### üêç Python script
A script for Raspberry pi that handles the rotary phone's input (such as numbers and detecting if the headset is picked up or put down.
### üì¶ Chrome extension
This chrome extension is to be installed on the Raspberry Pi's Chromium browser. This is what enables the interfacing with the radiooooo.com website, without using the keyboard or mouse, but the telephone instead. 
#### Install the Chrome Extension
You can install the Chrome extension on your Raspberry Pi's Chromium browser. Here's how: <br>
- **Make sure you have chromium installed for Raspberry Pi** <br>
At first, we have to update our packages. Open a terminal and type in:<br>
```sudo apt-get update```
Then, you can install it also by using the packet manager:
```sudo apt-get install chromium-browser --yes```

- **Enable developer mode** <br>
Open you chromium browser and type ```chrome://extensions```in your URL bar <br>
This will take you to the extensions screen. <br>
Toggle the ```Developer Mode``` button on the top right of your screen

- **Load the extension** <br>
On the extension screen, click the ```Load Unpacked``` button and load the ```Chrome Extension``` folder<br>
Make sure your extension is enabled

- **Make sure it works** <br>
Visit [Radiooooo.com](https://radiooooo.com/)<br>
Press the '0' key<br>
This should click the '1900' button<br>
Now you know the extension works!


### ü§ñ Arduino code
The arduino code detects which country is selected on the map, and then sends the information via serial to the Raspberry Pi.
